            I actively engaged in various scientific events, training 
            programs, <br> and workshops focused on programming and software 
            development to enhance my technical expertise <br> and stay 
            updated with industry advancements. <br> These included attending 
            conferences such as Machine learning, <br> where I explored topics 
            like artificial intelligence and emerging 
            programming frameworks through expert-led sessions. <br> 
            Additionally, I participated in hands-on training sessions, 
            such as hackathon, <br> which deepened my understanding 
            of languages like Python and Java, as well as tools like TensorFlow 
            and Docker. <br> Interactive hackathons and coding bootcamps further 
            honed my problem-solving skills <br> by challenging me to create 
            innovative solutions under time constraints. <br> These events 
            not only enriched my knowledge of programming methodologies 
            and trends <br> but also provided valuable networking opportunities 
            with professionals and peers in the tech community.
